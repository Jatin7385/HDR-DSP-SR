# Self-Supervised Super-Resolution for Multi-Exposure Push-Frame Satellites (CVPR 2022)

[HDR-DSP](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Nguyen_Self-Supervised_Super-Resolution_for_Multi-Exposure_Push-Frame_Satellites_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf) is the first joint super-resolution and HDR neural network for push-frame satellites. HDR-DSP can be trained on real data thanks to self-supervised learning.
